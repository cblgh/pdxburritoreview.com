              A really solid option if you want a heavy burrito. They also have fantastic tortas.
              Considering it's really one of the few places up in the NW Industrial, I really
              recommend it. They also put these really good little potato pieces inside their
              food and it's amazing.

              Another NW Industrial staple, it kind of sucks. I think I went there once and just
              remember the burrito being kind of soggy and the sauce being kind of lame. Pale food,
              standard red and green sauce, it's actually a cart with a bolted on facade. Real cheap
              though!

              Pearl district average. The one thing that stood out, or what I really remember, is that
              they have their process down really well. You go from tortilla to wrapped hot burrito very
              quickly. The cart down near the OHSU area is (was? I'm not sure it's still there) was even
              faster.

              This cart moves around and is more of a coffee thing, but they have an incredibly good
              brisket burrito that is fantastic. Heavy as hell but very tasty. Slightly more expensive
              than your standard burrito.

             I like this place mostly because of it's location, but what really
             sold me is eventually the woman behind the counter learned my name
             and it was really nice. Their burrito is heavy as hell and a little
               oily, but fantastic. They recommend their carnitas.

              It's a Chipotle, and part of the fast-food mexican mini-mall on Broadway. Remember,
              guac is free if you eat veggie, and if you spend enough dollars to accrue 1250 points
              (about 17 $7.25 veggie burritos) you get a free one. Nice!

              Taco Bell. Also part of the fast-food mexican mini-mall. This one is sketchy as shit though,
              and it seems to always be weirdly chipper teenagers behind the counter. This is a solid B-team
              location, nut nowhere near as bad as the one out on Barbur. I've only ever really gotten the
              Bean and Rice burritos here, so good luck. Good place to start a ride.

              Taco Bell. I think this is one of the better ones in PDX, as it's a little farther away from weird
              homeless activity. It's right near the entrance to Swan Island so you can go eat your burrito at a
              superfund site if you really want to. This one seems to be slightly faster than the others.

              This place is amazing, and another staple in the fast-food mexican mini-mall on Broadway. I don't
              know why I avoided this place for so long, it's amazing. You can get a single vegetarian burrito
              with guac and cheese for $4.89. HOT DAMN. Get two! They're fast and crazy nice. It feels scummy
              from the outside, like Javier's or Ole Ole, but it's rad in there. One time I went in and there
              was just one woman standing behind the counter in like 2 inches of water and she didn't skip a
              beat. Muchas Gracias is dank/10. They're also open until 4AM, seven days a week.

              Google's current photos for the place describe it pretty perfectly: sad looking chairs sitting around
              two tables pushed together and a pale-orange, flourescent hellscape. Super cheap. This place is open until 3AM and
              right off Lombard, so it's great for car thieves and truckers. You'll see all sorts of people there. I
              actually usually get the tacos, which are slightly larger than street size and covered in cheese, so
              I don't really know how their burritos are. They have pretty good sauces and pickled stuff, too.

              I'm not really a QDoba guy, and I've only been to this one twice. Part of the Broadway mexican
              fast-food mini-mall. I think this is the gold-standard for perfectly average mexican food. The
              burrito was not memorable and I think it's always dark inside for some reason.

              Azteca is rad. Theres also a bar next door. This is one of those pale-food-with-red-and-green-sauce places, like Javier's
              and Muchas Gracias. That means it's HELLA CHEAP DOG! Get two burritos and feel like you won the lottery.

              Los Gorditos. Good orange sauce. Good burritos. Lots of vegan/veggie options. I think this one
              doesn't shine quite as brightly as the Division and Downtown locations. Still good. The
              garbage burrito is fantastic.

              Don't sleep on this cart just because you're close to Los G's and the highway, they have really
              good quesadillas here, and their sauces are hot.

              Baja Fresh has really good burritos somehow, but they like to put their razor sharp tortilla chips
              in them so be warned.

              They do tacos here and their rigid stance on using only GIANT FANS when it's REALLY HOT outside
              is refreshing in a world where you could literally walk across the street to Fred Meyer's to buy
              an air conditioner. Not bad tacos, lots of options other that the standard Al Pastor/Carnitas/Chicken.

              Solid burritos with good vegan/veggie options. They like to touch up the spice. It's on alberta so
              you can stand in line to get Ice Cream afterwards, too.

              I don't really like this place, it's more of a bar that happens to serve food, and everyone thinks
              it's a food place that serves mezcal. They have a skull in their logo so that's pretty cool. They're
              pretty busy a lot of the time and the parking lot sucks. I don't think I have anything useful to
              say other than that their nachos were alright, and they give you free chips.

              Get the machaca or the mojado. Good price for a huge burrito. Red sauce is the way to go.
